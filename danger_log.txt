1. If response that server sent status code is not 200, we don't deal with this response.

2. If we input a wrong website that server can't find website address, proxy will return 404 and keep running.

3. Proxy may receive some evil requests or responses, which we may not handled yet.

4. We can't guarantee memory won't leak because of multiple threads.

5. Browser has local cache, so browser still can store and send revalidate request.

6. For cache situation, we need to deal with request/response header that don't have cache-control tag, expire tag. In this case, we cacluate the expire time manually to judge whether it is refresh.

7. Time value is UTC.

8. The cache size is 200.

9. Until proxy received all the response/request, it will send to browser or server. Thus, the speed of cache is slow when website has lots of material.

10. Not cacheable is due to several reasons: private and no-store.

11. If header contains max_age=0 or no-cache, we need revalidate from server.
 
12. It is possible for our program to be terminated when a exception throwing, since there exists some corner cases that were not considered by us.

13. Some website may take lot of time to load. A thread pool might be considered in the future.

14. Sometimes the browser cannot successfully load a page, but refreshing it can fix this issue.
